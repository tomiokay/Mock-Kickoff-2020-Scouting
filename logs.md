### 2025-10-20 - Toggle Button Functionality for Single-Use Actions

**Updates:**

1. **Toggle Button Implementation**
   - Converted single-use actions to toggle buttons:
     - Cross Initiation Line (auto)
     - Park (endgame)
     - Hang/Climb (endgame)
     - Level Switch (endgame)

2. **Toggle Behavior**
   - First click: Activates action, adds to timeline, adds points, shows ‚úì
   - Second click: Deactivates action, removes from timeline, subtracts points, shows 0
   - Prevents accidentally counting these actions multiple times
   - Allows scouts to correct mistakes

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Active toggle buttons display with enhanced glow effect
   - Brighter background color when active
   - Checkmark (‚úì) instead of number in counter badge
   - Clear visual distinction between active and inactive states

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Added `active-toggle` CSS class for visual state
   - Modified `recordAction()` to handle toggle vs increment logic
   - Added `removeLastActionFromTimeline()` function
   - Updated `updateScores()` to accept multiplier parameter (-1 for undo)
   - Timeline items now have data-action attribute for targeted removal
   - Reset function clears all toggle states

5. **Score Calculation**
   - Scores correctly add when toggled on
   - Scores correctly subtract when toggled off
   - Real-time score updates maintained

**Files Modified:**
- `script.js` - Toggle logic, timeline removal, score multiplier
- `styles.css` - Active toggle button styling
- `README.md` - Documented toggle functionality
- `logs.md` - This entry

**Reasoning:**
These actions can only physically happen once per match in FRC. A robot either crosses the line or doesn't, either hangs or doesn't. Toggle buttons prevent data entry errors and match the physical reality of the game.
